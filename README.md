## Installation

The preferred method of installation is via [Packagist][] and [Composer][]. Run
the following command to install the package and add it as a requirement to
your project's `composer.json`:

```bash
composer require vasildakov/postcode-doctrine
```


## Configuration

To configure Doctrine to use vasildakov/postcode as a field type, you'll need to set up
the following in your bootstrap:

``` php
\Doctrine\DBAL\Types\Type::addType('postcode', 'VasilDakov\Postcode\Doctrine\PostcodeType');
```

Then, in your models, you may annotate properties by setting the `@Column`
type to `postcode`.

``` php
/**
 * @Entity
 * @Table(name="address")
 */
class Address
{
    /**
     * @var \VasilDakov\Postcode\Postcode
     * @Column(type="postcode")
     */
    protected $postcode;

    public function getPostcode()
    {
        return $this->postcode;
    }
}
```
